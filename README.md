### About the project

### Built without dotnet. Just two plain .cs files for the assignment requirements

### Get started


> Prerequisites\
1.install homebrew via 
                /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"\ \
                2.brew install mono


> Installation -> using mcs is also possible (i think). csc is what i used (regarding the compiler) 

### Usage

### 1.Kruskal's algorithm

* kruskal.cs -> main algorithm but kruskal_with_class.cs also works but there is a slight inheritance issue that i need to fix. but it works :)

* how to run the program -> csc kruskal.cs && mono kruskal.exe

 - dotnet is not used to run the program. but you could copy and paste it into the program.cs file and get it working.
 
* Adjusting the program -> the input.txt file could be changed according to your wish and see the output

* How the program works is mentioned in the comments of of the program itself.

* The rest of the files are a major of my learning process. some are incomplete and i hope to complete them soon. you might have to figure out how to run them independently. some parts of the code have to be uncommented to witness different parts of how kruskal itself works and how the functions that are used to build it work. 


### Roadmap
### 1.Tasks to do to organize the repo more

- [x] Basic implementation with comments

- [x] Markdown completion

- [ ] Organize the repo more. file dependencies are not in the two .cs files. all are single files \
where the input.txt file has to be in the root of the project(same level).

- [ ] time complexity was not cleary understood yet. need to look into that

- [ ] Implementation in other languages have to be finished
