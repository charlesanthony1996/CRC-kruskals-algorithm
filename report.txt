all the test files are empty since they were just a testing environment before they were taken to their
respective files

-----------------------------

a high level overview of kruskals algorithm

1.sort the edges of the graph in non-decreasing/ascending order of weight

2.get an empty set to display the mst

3.for each edge from the sorted list of edges
- if adding the edge to the mst does not create a cycle add the edge
- otherwise ignore it, since there are so many connections, to understand this check the ufds.py example
-

4.display and return the final mst

---------------------


how does the ufds and kruskals combine to complete the algorithm?

ufds -> checks for cycles and merges the sets
kruskals -> does the mst for the graph

--------------------------

time complexity has to be understood still for kruskal
